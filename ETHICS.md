# Ethical Considerations

In the development and execution of this IMDB Top Movies Data Pipeline project, I have carefully considered and addressed several ethical aspects:

## Data Collection and Usage

1. Web Scraping:
   - I respected the `robots.txt` file of IMDB and ensure the scraping adheres to their guidelines.
   - I implemented rate limiting in the scraping to avoid overwhelming IMDB's servers.

2. API Usage:
   - I used the OMDB API in accordance with their terms of service and usage limits.
   - The API key is stored securely and not exposed in the public repository.

## Data Privacy and Protection

1. I only collected and processed publicly available data about movies, not personal information.
2. I do not store or process any user data beyond the immediate session of running the script.

## Transparency and Attribution

1. I clearly stated the data sources (IMDB and OMDB) in the documentation.
2. I do not claim ownership of the original data, only of the combined and processed dataset.

## Accuracy and Integrity

1. I implemented data cleaning processes to ensure the accuracy of the final dataset.
2. I provided clear documentation on how the data is collected and processed, allowing users to understand any potential biases or limitations.

## Accessibility and Fairness

1. The code and methodology are open-source, promoting transparency and allowing for community review and improvement.
2.I strived to maintain a neutral perspective in the data collection, not favoring any particular genre, studio, or region.

## Environmental Considerations

1. I optimized the code to minimize unnecessary API calls and reduce computational resources, thereby minimizing the environmental impact.

## Continuous Improvement

I am committed to continuously reviewing and improving the ethical practices. I welcome feedback from the community on how I can further enhance the ethical aspects of this project. By adhering to these ethical guidelines, I aim to create a valuable resource for the community while respecting the rights and interests of all stakeholders involved.
